# Jasmini

This library provides a small, Jasmine-like testing system. It can be used as
a standalone library to be embedded into your application or as a pull testing
application. The goal was to go general purpose, a number of Jasmine-esque
libraries already exist but they are very fixed in the way they should be
used or rely to heavily on global state.
